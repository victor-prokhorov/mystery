## Setup and file structure

For bootstrapping i used create-react-app with redux-typescript template. As per redux recommendations i preserved per feature file structure and also per feature unit testing. To see if the element is correctly rendered by position i used App.test.tsx as per template.

## Description

The main purpose of the component is to show received child and passed icon. The position of both is controlled by `iconPos` prop
